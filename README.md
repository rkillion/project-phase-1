# Overview

This is Alan and Bob's project for Phase 1: a site for photographers to display a gallery of images.

We will start with images from Pixabay, a photography api.

# Deliverables

1. The user can search for photographs by topic and receive back a gallery of images.
2. The user can "like" images.
3. The user can upload images from a url.
